# CPE552JavaSolarSystem
# Assignment：
Define an object to represent all the information for a body in a solar system.
The file is in the data directory.  Your program should load that file with no path, because if you specify a path on your computer it will be wrong for the graders.  Download the file and put it in the base directory of your Netbeans project which is the default directory.

Each of your objects should store:

Name of the body
Mass
Diameter
What it orbits
Mean distance from what it orbits
Create objects representing the sun, venus, earth, and our moon.

Write the SolarSystem object containing an ArrayList< >  of the bodies

For now, just read in and print out.

Read in file "solarsystem.dat" and create an object called SolarSystem which has a list of all the bodies in the file. Set the attributes of each Body, including Name of the body, Mass, Diameter, What it orbits and Mean distance from what it orbits. Finally print out the list that contains all the bodies in the solar system.
